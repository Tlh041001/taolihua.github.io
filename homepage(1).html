                  <p class="project-intro">This task involved creating a stop-motion animation using pictures taken from
                    different angles and shot sizes to tell a story. My storyboard follows a potato as it transforms
                    into a hash brown, using various perspectives like high-angle long shots and close-ups to bring the
                    narrative to life in a fun and engaging way.
                    During the process, I realized that achieving smooth transitions between frames requires precise
                    planning and more frequent captures. While the final video effectively conveyed the story, the
                    pacing could have been improved by including additional frames and a wider variety of angles to make
                    the animation feel more dynamic.
                    This project highlighted the importance of consistency in camera angles and shot composition to
                    ensure a smooth and cohesive animation. It also showed me how seemingly minor elements, such as the
                    placement of props or the timing of movements, can greatly influence the emotional tone and visual
                    appeal of the final product.

                  <p class="project-intro">This video essay aims to analyze and discuss the portrayal of Maleficent in
                    Maleficent (2014). I selected two key scenes—Maleficent cursing Aurora and later kissing her out of
                    remorse—to explore how director Robert Stromberg utilizes camera work, lighting design, and sound
                    effects to depict Maleficent’s duality as both a villainous figure and a character capable of
                    empathy.
                    Throughout this analysis, I gained a deeper understanding of how cinematic techniques work together
                    to construct complex character portrayals. For instance, in the cursing scene, Stromberg’s use of
                    low-angle shots and stark lighting emphasized Maleficent’s power and anger. Conversely, in the
                    kissing scene, warm tones and soft music highlighted her vulnerability and remorse. This stark
                    contrast revealed how Stromberg challenges traditional binary notions of good and evil by adding
                    depth to characters.
                    However, analyzing subtle details in lighting and sound design proved challenging, as these elements
                    often influence the audience on a subconscious level. By breaking down the scenes frame by frame, I
                    uncovered how small changes, such as the placement of light sources or shifts in musical tone, can
                    have a profound emotional impact.
                    Overall, this task enhanced my ability to critically analyze cinematic works and deepened my
                    appreciation for how Stromberg integrates technical elements with narrative. It underscored the
                    importance of meticulous attention to detail in creating emotionally resonant and visually
                    compelling storytelling.
