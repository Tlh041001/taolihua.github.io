                  <p class="project-intro">This video essay aims to analyze and discuss the portrayal of Maleficent in
                    Maleficent (2014). I selected two key scenes—Maleficent cursing Aurora and later kissing her out of
                    remorse—to explore how director Robert Stromberg utilizes camera work, lighting design, and sound
                    effects to depict Maleficent's duality as both a villainous figure and a character capable of
                    empathy.
                    Throughout this analysis, I gained a deeper understanding of how cinematic techniques work together
                    to construct complex character portrayals. For instance, in the cursing scene, Stromberg's use of
                    low-angle shots and stark lighting emphasized Maleficent's power and anger. Conversely, in the
                    kissing scene, warm tones and soft music highlighted her vulnerability and remorse. This stark
                    contrast revealed how Stromberg challenges traditional binary notions of good and evil by adding
                    depth to characters.
                    However, analyzing subtle details in lighting and sound design proved challenging, as these elements
                    often influence the audience on a subconscious level. By breaking down the scenes frame by frame, I
                    uncovered how small changes, such as the placement of light sources or shifts in musical tone, can
                    have a profound emotional impact.
                    Overall, this task enhanced my ability to critically analyze cinematic works and deepened my
                    appreciation for how Stromberg integrates technical elements with narrative. It underscored the
                    importance of meticulous attention to detail in creating emotionally resonant and visually
                    compelling storytelling.

          During the project, I gained valuable experience in collaborative planning and execution, conducted an in-depth analysis of Friedlander’s unique artistic style, and experimented with replicating his works through lens language and composition techniques. Additionally, I learned how to redesign the recreated works to incorporate personal creativity, while enhancing skills in video editing, voiceover narration, and the application of cinematic concepts such as shot sizes and angles. This task provided me with a deeper understanding of the unique charm and value of photography as both an art form and a storytelling tool.

          The focus of this task was to storyboard and film a short sequence titled The Shoe. The narrative required depicting a character noticing their shoelace is untied, expressing frustration, kneeling to tie the shoelace, and continuing to walk. My storyboard utilized a combination of wide, mid, and close-up shots, employing various shot sizes and angles to effectively convey the storyline.

        During the storyboard design process, ensuring seamless transitions between shots emerged as a critical challenge. Particularly in the initial planning stages, achieving natural continuity in actions and perspectives between different shots required significant attention. This encouraged a deeper focus on shot composition and action continuity to create a fluid and cohesive visual narrative. The most valuable learning from this project was mastering the use of establishing shots to effectively set the scene and help the audience quickly grasp the story’s context. Additionally, I practiced continuity editing, ensuring smooth transitions by precisely matching the character's actions across shots. Furthermore, I developed skills in marking actor positions to streamline the shooting process and used comprehensive shot coverage to enhance flexibility and creative options during post-production.

This task was not only an opportunity to practice video production but also a way to organize ideas visually. While creating the storyboard, I learned how to translate abstract ideas into specific visual layouts, pre-plan the sequence of shots, and set the rhythm for the story, which made the actual filming process more efficient and organized.

            In the lighting workshop, we explored the use of key light and fill light to emphasize subjects and shape the overall visual composition. This practical session in the photography studio allowed us to analyze how lighting interacts with various angles and camera shots to convey distinct emotions and atmospheres.<br><br>
            Additionally, we incorporated props to enrich the visual dynamics, experimenting with the intensity and placement of lights and utilizing different colors to create depth and enhance the emotional tone of the scene. This workshop provided valuable insights into the pivotal role of lighting in visual storytelling and demonstrated how thoughtful light design can elevate both artistic expression and narrative impact.

        <p style="text-align:left;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;font-size: 18px">
          This was my first attempt at writing a feature article for a media newsroom project. Our topic explored oversharing culture through student interviews and the case of Kanye West, using an entertainment-style headline to draw attention before delving into more serious reflections on social behaviour.
          <br><br>
          Through this task, I learned how to maintain a consistent message while crafting content that captures audience interest. It also helped me understand the importance of layout and formatting in making a feature article clear and engaging. After completing this article, I realized that if I take on a similar article-writing task in the future, I should outline the structure earlier, spend more time on editing, and seek feedback from the editor or teammates to improve clarity and flow.

          Building on the ideas explored in our article, my group created a podcast that approached the topic of oversharing in a humorous and discussion way. To prepare, we divided the script equally, added a voting segment, where each member shared a story, and chose the most awkward one to make this podcast sounds more interesting.
          <br><br>
          Also, practicing in the library’s recording studio and completing a full recording session at RMIT SYN Radio was a new experience for me. It gave me the opportunity to become familiar with the entire recording process, which from adjusting microphone placement to managing voice tone and volume. This podcast workshop experience not only strengthened my communication skills, but also taught me how to keep a podcast engaging and cohesive, even when discussing more serious themes beneath the humor.

          In the final assignment, our PSA campaign aimed to deliver an anti-bullying message in a fun and creative way that appeals to children. Inspired by fast food and collectible blind boxes, we created five fun characters, each representing a step against bullying, such as building up courage or giving support. To promote the campaign, we used three strategies: a poster menu, #AntiBullyChallenge videos, and advertisement video. I was responsible for character design, 3D model layout, and packaging visuals design in this campaign.        <p>

          One of the main challenges was balancing visual appeal with meaningful content, as we wanted the product to be fun but still deliver a strong message, while after held a few team discussions and made multiple changes, we overcame these difficulties. Thereby, the biggest success for our team was turning the original ideas into a tangible product — one with a strong visual identity that children found fun and easy to understand, while also clearly delivering an anti-bullying message. From this, I learned how creativity and purpose can work together.
          <br><br>
          However, one area we could improve is target audience testing, which getting feedback from actual children. This step can help us better tailor the design and language to their understanding and be closer to their interests. This assignment and experience helped me develop skills in campaign promotion, including how to use visuals and packaging to engage a young audience, further raise awareness of social issues.

      <p style="text-align:left;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.8;">
        During this year by studying media and communication, I explored a wide range of creative and communication-based media assignments — from storytelling and short-form video in Semester one to journalism, podcasting, and campaign work in Semester two. Each project challenged me to communicate ideas clearly and creatively, while tailoring content to different audiences.
        <br><br>
        Each semester had a distinct focus. Semester one was centered on building technical skills and personal creative exploration, through tasks like the daily vlog, lighting workshop, photographic emulation, and stop-motion animation. These helped me develop my understanding of composition, lighting, timing, and editing, also discovering my visual style in this progress. In contrast, Semester two emphasized strategic communication and media’s role in social impact. Projects like the citizen journalism video, podcast on oversharing, and PSA campaign taught me how to structure narratives, think about audience engagement, and combine visuals with clear messaging. The PSA campaign in particular helped me apply design and communication together, which using 3D characters, packaging, posters, and an ad video to deliver an anti-bullying message to children.
        <br><br>
        Over the past year, I have not only strengthened my creative and technical skills, but also improved my ability to plan and express ideas. Through doing a few assignments, I have gained a clearer understanding of my future academic and career path, which means I found that what I was truly interested in marketing communication.
        <br><br>
        Finally, I am also very grateful to have met Yuliya as my tutor and lecturer during the learning process. She always gives me encouragement and useful feedback, which enables me to build up confidence in the process of media content planning, visual design and purposeful production.

      <p style="text-align:left;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.8;">
        For this citizen journalism task, I created a short soft news video reporting on the recent “migration” of American TikTok users to the Chinese platform RedNote, calling themselves "TikTok refugees."
        <br><br>
        To prepare, I watched many related news videos and articles from Chinese and American platform. These reference not only gave me a basic understanding of the news reporting process, but also guided me on how to efficiently deliver key information within a limited time frame.

      In this video, to enhance the depth and visual appeal of the report, I included supporting visuals such as some video clips showing friendly interactions between Chinese and American users. While the story was timely and visually rich, I realized that I need to improve in editing. For example, adding a formal news broadcast background and channel branding could make the report appear more professional and credible, which also help viewers associate it more with authentic news content.

        <br><br>
      This task not only gave me an experience in planning and producing a structurally complete and accurate citizen news video, but also helped me realize that while soft news may not focus on hard data, it can still effectively respond to social issues through storytelling and visual language.
