                    Maleficent (2014). I selected two key scenes—Maleficent cursing Aurora and later kissing her out of
                    remorse—to explore how director Robert Stromberg utilizes camera work, lighting design, and sound
                    effects to depict Maleficent’s duality as both a villainous figure and a character capable of
                    empathy.
                    Throughout this analysis, I gained a deeper understanding of how cinematic techniques work together
                    to construct complex character portrayals. For instance, in the cursing scene, Stromberg’s use of
                    low-angle shots and stark lighting emphasized Maleficent’s power and anger. Conversely, in the
                    kissing scene, warm tones and soft music highlighted her vulnerability and remorse. This stark
                    contrast revealed how Stromberg challenges traditional binary notions of good and evil by adding
                    depth to characters.
                    However, analyzing subtle details in lighting and sound design proved challenging, as these elements
                    often influence the audience on a subconscious level. By breaking down the scenes frame by frame, I
                    uncovered how small changes, such as the placement of light sources or shifts in musical tone, can
                    have a profound emotional impact.
                    Overall, this task enhanced my ability to critically analyze cinematic works and deepened my
                    appreciation for how Stromberg integrates technical elements with narrative. It underscored the
                    importance of meticulous attention to detail in creating emotionally resonant and visually
                    compelling storytelling.

          This was our first group presentation task in the Media and Communications course. The assignment required us to select a renowned photographer, recreate three of their iconic works, and present our creative outcomes and research process through a comprehensive video essay. Our group chose Lee Friedlander, whose signature photography is characterized by reflections, shadows, and urban landscapes, showcasing a distinctive style.

          During the project, I gained valuable experience in collaborative planning and execution, conducted an in-depth analysis of Friedlander’s unique artistic style, and experimented with replicating his works through lens language and composition techniques. Additionally, I learned how to redesign the recreated works to incorporate personal creativity, while enhancing skills in video editing, voiceover narration, and the application of cinematic concepts such as shot sizes and angles. This task provided me with a deeper understanding of the unique charm and value of photography as both an art form and a storytelling tool.

          The focus of this task was to storyboard and film a short sequence titled The Shoe. The narrative required depicting a character noticing their shoelace is untied, expressing frustration, kneeling to tie the shoelace, and continuing to walk. My storyboard utilized a combination of wide, mid, and close-up shots, employing various shot sizes and angles to effectively convey the storyline.

        During the storyboard design process, ensuring seamless transitions between shots emerged as a critical challenge. Particularly in the initial planning stages, achieving natural continuity in actions and perspectives between different shots required significant attention. This encouraged a deeper focus on shot composition and action continuity to create a fluid and cohesive visual narrative. The most valuable learning from this project was mastering the use of establishing shots to effectively set the scene and help the audience quickly grasp the story’s context. Additionally, I practiced continuity editing, ensuring smooth transitions by precisely matching the character's actions across shots. Furthermore, I developed skills in marking actor positions to streamline the shooting process and used comprehensive shot coverage to enhance flexibility and creative options during post-production.

          In one of our early media studies tasks, we were required to create a 60-second vlog documenting "A Day in My Life" and prepare a storyboard beforehand as a planning tool. This task was not only an opportunity to practice video production but also a way to organize ideas visually. While creating the storyboard, I learned how to translate abstract ideas into specific visual layouts, pre-plan the sequence of shots, and set the rhythm for the story, which made the actual filming process more efficient and organized.

            In the lighting workshop, we explored the use of key light and fill light to emphasize subjects and shape the overall visual composition. This practical session in the photography studio allowed us to analyze how lighting interacts with various angles and camera shots to convey distinct emotions and atmospheres.<br><br>
            Additionally, we incorporated props to enrich the visual dynamics, experimenting with the intensity and placement of lights and utilizing different colors to create depth and enhance the emotional tone of the scene. This workshop provided valuable insights into the pivotal role of lighting in visual storytelling and demonstrated how thoughtful light design can elevate both artistic expression and narrative impact.
