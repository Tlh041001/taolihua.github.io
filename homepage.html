                  <p class="project-intro">In one of our early media studies tasks, we were required to create a
                    60-second vlog documenting "A Day in My Life" and prepare a storyboard beforehand as a planning
                    tool. This task was not only an opportunity to practice video production but also a way to organize
                    ideas visually. While creating the storyboard, I learned how to translate abstract ideas into
                    specific visual layouts, pre-plan the sequence of shots, and set the rhythm for the story, which
                    made the actual filming process more efficient and organized.
                    This task highlighted the importance of planning—storyboards are not just a pre-shooting aid but
                    also a crucial part of expressing creativity and structured thinking. Additionally, working within
                    the time limit taught me how to deliver impactful messages with minimal footage, improving my
                    ability to prioritize content effectively.

                    emphasize subjects and shape the overall visual composition. This practical session in the
                    photography studio allowed us to analyze how lighting interacts with various angles and camera shots
                    to convey distinct emotions and atmospheres.
                    Additionally, we incorporated props to enrich the visual dynamics, experimenting with the intensity
                    and placement of lights and utilizing different colors to create depth and enhance the emotional
                    tone of the scene. This workshop provided valuable insights into the pivotal role of lighting in
                    visual storytelling and demonstrated how thoughtful light design can elevate both artistic
                    expression and narrative impact.

                  <p class="project-intro">This was our first group presentation task in the Media and Communications
                    course. The assignment required us to select a renowned photographer, recreate three of their iconic
                    works, and present our creative outcomes and research process through a comprehensive video essay.
                    Our group chose Lee Friedlander, whose signature photography is characterized by reflections,
                    shadows, and urban landscapes, showcasing a distinctive style.
                    During the project, I gained valuable experience in collaborative planning and execution, conducted
                    an in-depth analysis of Friedlander’s unique artistic style, and experimented with replicating his
                    works through lens language and composition techniques. Additionally, I learned how to redesign the
                    recreated works to incorporate personal creativity, while enhancing skills in video editing,
                    voiceover narration, and the application of cinematic concepts such as shot sizes and angles. This
                    task provided me with a deeper understanding of the unique charm and value of photography as both an
                    art form and a storytelling tool.

                  <p class="project-intro">The focus of this task was to storyboard and film a short sequence titled The
                    Shoe. The narrative required depicting a character noticing their shoelace is untied, expressing
                    frustration, kneeling to tie the shoelace, and continuing to walk. My storyboard utilized a
                    combination of wide, mid, and close-up shots, employing various shot sizes and angles to effectively
                    convey the storyline.
                    During the storyboard design process, ensuring seamless transitions between shots emerged as a
                    critical challenge. Particularly in the initial planning stages, achieving natural continuity in
                    actions and perspectives between different shots required significant attention. This encouraged a
                    deeper focus on shot composition and action continuity to create a fluid and cohesive visual
                    narrative.
                    The most valuable learning from this project was mastering the use of establishing shots to
                    effectively set the scene and help the audience quickly grasp the story’s context. Additionally, I
                    practiced continuity editing, ensuring smooth transitions by precisely matching the character's
                    actions across shots. Furthermore, I developed skills in marking actor positions to streamline the
                    shooting process and used comprehensive shot coverage to enhance flexibility and creative options
                    during post-production.

                  </picture>
                  <p class="project-intro">This task involved creating a stop-motion animation using pictures taken from
                    different angles and shot sizes to tell a story. My storyboard follows a potato as it transforms
                    into a hash brown, using various perspectives like high-angle long shots and close-ups to bring the
                    narrative to life in a fun and engaging way.
                    During the process, I realized that achieving smooth transitions between frames requires precise
                    planning and more frequent captures. While the final video effectively conveyed the story, the
                    pacing could have been improved by including additional frames and a wider variety of angles to make
                    the animation feel more dynamic.
                    This project highlighted the importance of consistency in camera angles and shot composition to
                    ensure a smooth and cohesive animation. It also showed me how seemingly minor elements, such as the
                    placement of props or the timing of movements, can greatly influence the emotional tone and visual
                    appeal of the final product.

                  <p class="project-intro">This video essay aims to analyze and discuss the portrayal of Maleficent in
                    Maleficent (2014). I selected two key scenes—Maleficent cursing Aurora and later kissing her out of
                    remorse—to explore how director Robert Stromberg utilizes camera work, lighting design, and sound
                    effects to depict Maleficent’s duality as both a villainous figure and a character capable of
                    empathy.
                    Throughout this analysis, I gained a deeper understanding of how cinematic techniques work together
                    to construct complex character portrayals. For instance, in the cursing scene, Stromberg’s use of
                    low-angle shots and stark lighting emphasized Maleficent’s power and anger. Conversely, in the
                    kissing scene, warm tones and soft music highlighted her vulnerability and remorse. This stark
                    contrast revealed how Stromberg challenges traditional binary notions of good and evil by adding
                    depth to characters.
                    However, analyzing subtle details in lighting and sound design proved challenging, as these elements
                    often influence the audience on a subconscious level. By breaking down the scenes frame by frame, I
                    uncovered how small changes, such as the placement of light sources or shifts in musical tone, can
                    have a profound emotional impact.
                    Overall, this task enhanced my ability to critically analyze cinematic works and deepened my
                    appreciation for how Stromberg integrates technical elements with narrative. It underscored the
                    importance of meticulous attention to detail in creating emotionally resonant and visually
                    compelling storytelling.

          Billie Eilish serves as a significant inspiration for my creative work. Her dark, melancholic music style,
          combined with deeply personal and introspective lyrics, resonates with me on both an emotional and artistic
          level. The way she translates complex emotions into haunting melodies has influenced my own approach to
          storytelling and expression.</br></br>
          Her journey of embracing individuality and breaking conventional norms has also shaped my perspective,
          encouraging me to explore themes of vulnerability, authenticity, and introspection in my creations. Through
          her music and personal story, she has inspired me to push boundaries and craft a style that reflects my unique
          experiences and emotions.
